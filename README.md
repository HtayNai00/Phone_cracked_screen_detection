## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git@github.com:KoPyae455/Phone_cracked_screen_detection.git
   cd Phone_Cracked_Screen_Detection

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use
Prepare the Dataset:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory, organized into train/, test/, and validation/.
Run the Notebooks:

Open Jupyter Notebook:
Execute the notebooks in the following order:

data_preprocessing.ipynb (for data preparation and augmentation)

model_training.ipynb (for training the CNN model)

model_evaluation.ipynb (for evaluating the model performance)

Save the trained model from models/model.pth.
Use the model in your application or deployment pipeline.

## 📊 Results
The CNN achieved the following metrics:

Accuracy: 95% on the test dataset

Precision: 93%

Recall: 94%

F1-Score: 93.5%

Note: Results may vary based on dataset quality and model configuration.
